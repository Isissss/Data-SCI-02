# Data science for IOT 
Data Science IOT - Keuzevak HR periode 2, 2022

## Idea 
Originally, I wanted to make a diary bot, that would read your emotions while you were telling the bot a story about your day to get more insight on your welbeing. After doing some research online, I sadly came to the conclusion that this was too complicated with my level of experience and the time we were given for this project. Although I have some IoT experience, I am relatively new to coding and had no experience with the language and device provided to us.

I started thinking about what else I could do, and started thinking about school and work. A healthy environment is a must while you are at work or school (or just at home). Not just because of covid, but it's important at any time. The room temperature and humidity play a part in that. A high humidity percentage stimulates the growth of micro-organisms. This can lead to allergic reactions and problems such as tightness of the chest, headaches, coughing and a chronical nose cold, which all has a negative effect on your overall workflow. These are all issues that will only show up after some time, but concenstration issues can occur right away. 

## Goal of the project
I have set some personal goals for this project, and ofcourse the end-goal of this project.

#### Project
I want to show the status of the humidity and temperature through a simple device so that simple things, such as opening a window, are done before the issues listed earlier occur. The information should be tracked and saved. It should then be used on an external website, which provides the last status, a daily, weekly and a monthly report of the avarage temperature and humidity. That way you can spot trends (let's say the humidity is much higer on a certain day, you can increase the ventilation beforehand) but also assure people that the humidity and temperature is healthy to work in. 

I am going to try to achieve this Internet of Things application through the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ device, which is connecte
